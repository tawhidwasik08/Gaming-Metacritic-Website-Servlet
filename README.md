# Gaming-Metacritic-Website-Servlet
***Implemented using : java servlet, html, MySQL***<br>
It's a personal academic project I've worked on the final semester of varsity.<br>
The idea was to create a simple gaming review website for users along with reviews from other big websites. I've already implemented a site similar to this using php. This project was for learning Java servelet. So, basically it's just a port of that website idea in servlet.<br>
